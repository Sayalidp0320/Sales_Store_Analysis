# Sales_Store_Analysis- SQL Project

## Store Background:
A retail store chain tracks daily sales transactions, including order details, customer info, product categories, order times, and order status. The business wants to optimize operations, improve customer experience, and increase profitability using data-driven decisions.

## Problem Statement:

The store doesnâ€™t have a clear idea about :-
1.	Which products sell the most
2.	Customers preference
3.	Which items bring in the most profit
4.	Where things are going wrong in delivery or operations. Because of this, they are missing chances to earn more, losing customers, and making poor business decisions.
